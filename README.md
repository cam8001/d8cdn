# d8cdn
A site for testing Drupal 8 CDN integration.

There is a make file for building the site, and a shell script for installing it.

The site is based on [Demo Framework](https://drupal.org/profile/df), which
allows us to easily have a fully featured Drupal 8 site for testing.

We are integrating [Purge](https://drupal.org/project/purge) and 
[Akamai](http://drupal.org/project/akamai) modules to test dynamic, URL and tag
based purging.

This site is intended to be deployed to Acquia Cloud, but can easily be deployed
anywhere.
